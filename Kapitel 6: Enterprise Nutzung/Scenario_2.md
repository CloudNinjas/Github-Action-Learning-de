# Infrastructure Factory

In big cooperations there is not one team that can mange everything alone. Rather multiple teams work towards the same goal. With infrastructure factory we define the deployment of multiple similar resources in multiple cloud environments or in one global cloud environment. 

To make an example: 
It is more efficient to define one infrastructure component and to use the similar one in multiple scenarios. We can have a look at for example a simple database. If you deploy a database to a cloud environment you have similar requirements. The database needs to be secured in some fashion (e.g., encryption on rest), it needs to have access from a backend application, or it has to comply to general principals defined in and from outside of the the cooperation.


This infrastructure component you do not want to define multiple times but rather once.

## Sting it up

As already stated in previous chapters we can combine an DevOps mindset with deploying infrastructure. 
This means we use pipelines to deploy the single components in a standardized procedure. 

### Infrastructure as Code


### Pipelines

We use pipelines to create (copy and update files)
